<div style="margin-top: 1%; font-weight: bold; font-size: 48px;"> College Laundry System Redesign</div>

<div style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: 18px;"> This redesign was completed for the
   college course <a class="note" href="https://ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/DSGN.html">Design 1</a> (Design of Everyday Things). I worked with Roy Lincke, Vanessa Tse, Celine Wong,
   and EunSeo Cho on this project. Through user research, we were able to discover flaws in the on-campus
   laundry system at UCSD and purpose a solution to fulfill unmet user needs.  </div>

<div style="margin-top:1%; font-size: 20px"><u> OVERVIEW/DESIGN GOAL </u></div>
</center>
<div style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: 18px;"> The UCSD on-campus
  laundry system has many imperfections and has a lot of room for improvements and adjustments.
  Given the amount of complaints we received from our surveys and interviews, it is clear that a
  majority of the students who use the laundry machine has a general dissatisfaction with the system.  </div>
<center>

<div style="margin-top:5%; font-size: 20px"><u> MIND MAP </u></div>
</center>
  <div style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: 18px; float: left;"> Before going into observations and interviews,
    our group brainstormed the events that typically go on in an on-campus laundry room.
     We mentally went through our personal experiences and bounced ideas off of one another.  </div>
<center>
<img src="MindMap.png" class="image" style="float:left; margin-bottom:5%; margin-left: 16%; margin-top: 0%; width: 69%; height: 69%">


<div style="margin-top:5%; font-size: 20px"><u> ONLINE SURVEY - 189 RESPONSES </u></div>
</center>
<div style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: 18px;"> Before conducting field work, our team decided
  to distribute a survey regarding the UCSD laundry systems in order to learn more about the user base. The
  <a class="note" href="SurveyResults.csv">online survey</a>
    that we distributed received 189 responses from anonymous UCSD students
  over the course of 9 days (5/18-5/26).  In addition to asking them for information about their status as a student
  (year, in which dorm they live, etc.), we collected valuable data regarding their thoughts on the current UCSD laundry system.
  As the bar graph below reflects, it is evident that there is a large spread in student satisfaction for the laundry services on-campus
  which led us to believe that there was room for improvement.  </div>
<center>
<img src="Survey.png" class="image" style="float:left; margin-bottom:3%; margin-left: 16%; margin-top: 0%; width: 69%; height: 69%">

<div style="margin-top:0%; font-size: 20px"><u> INTERVIEWS/PERSONAS </u></div>
</center>
<div style="margin-top: 1%; font-size: 18px;"> After conducting many interviews with students,
   we were able to find similar complaints and problems:</div>
   <ol style="margin-top: 0.5%; margin-bottom: 2%; font-size: 18px;">
      <li>Whenever they faced a malfunctioning machine, people would generally use another machine and not bother calling
          HDH Maintenance to report the problem, claiming it as a waste of time.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;">Machines that did malfunction sometimes did not have clear messages indicating that they were out of order which
          added complications for the students who had already paid for the dysfunctional machine.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;">Many students were not satisfied with the hygiene and upkeep of the machines, stating that the amount of grime
          in some areas was worrisome as well as off-putting.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.5%;">There was a general agreement amongst students that there are not enough washing and dryer machines.</li>
   </ol>

<div style="margin-top:3%; font-size: 20px"><u> FINAL REDESIGN </u></div>
</center>
<div style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-size: 18px;"> The first step in our redesign is to ask students
  for either their phone number or email when setting up their laundry account so that notifications can be sent out
  when a student’s laundry is able to be picked up.
  Our machine would have the user’s information from when they swiped their ID to pay for their load. We believe
  that this would reduce the number of students that forget to pick up their laundry allowing more washers and dryers to be available.
  Along with the pick up notification, students will have the opportunity to press a button indicating when a machine is broken. This
  system will allow for machines to be repaired faster and indicate to other students which machines are broken
  and should not be used. </div>
<center>
<img src="LaundrySystem2.png" class="image" style=" width: 60%; height: 60%">
</center>
<div style="margin-top: 4%; margin-bottom: 4%; font-size: 18px;"> The picture below shows the process that we are trying to implement
  in our redesign. The blue arrows indicate actions taken, the red is for the signifiers, and the yellow is for communication. Our
  redesign is not just a collection of tangible added features, but rather a whole process of interactions. </div>
<center>
<img src="LaundrySystem.png" class="image" style=" margin-top: 2%; width: 50%; height:50%">

<div style="margin-top:5%; font-size: 20px"><u> REDESIGN EXPLANATION </u></div>
</center>
<div style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 4%; font-size: 18px;"> A lot of the problems, we found, stemmed from the fact that there
  was a lack of proper feedback from the system to the users. Such problems include people not picking up their laundry after it has
  finished, machines not giving proper notification that they do not work, and a lack of enough laundry machines for the amount of users.
  Due to these reasons, we created a feedback system that gave proper notifications through text and/or email to the users, who would
  then be able to take the proper actions to minimize error. Although there are certainly trade-offs to our feedback redesign, we feel
  that the overall features would aid the users more than without.
