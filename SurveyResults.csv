The thing where you put detergent and fanbric softener is filled with some sort of liquid most of the time and the interior of washing machines are always wet and smell like something is being decomposed. It's mainly due to people closing the doors after they take out their laundry not allowing moisture inside the machine to dry(which creates a perfect condition for bacterial growth). In hot weather, it gets even worse and there were several flies in the machine. The reason I don't do laundry as often as i used to back in my home is that using school laundry doesn't really make clothes clean but rather more contaminated.","I wish people are informed that they are supposed to leave the doors open and that the there are maintenance system to keep the machines sanitary(such as wiping the interior of the machines with ethanol).
